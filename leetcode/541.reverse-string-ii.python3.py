#
# 
# Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters
# for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are
# less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k
# but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k
# characters and left the other as original.
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
# Output: "bacdfeg"
# 
# 
# 
# Restrictions: 
# 
# ⁠The string consists of lower English letters only.
# ⁠Length of the given string and k will in the range [1, 10000]

        """
        res = ''
        i = 0 
        while i < len(s): 
            res = res + s[i:i+k][::-1] 
            res = res + s[i+k:i+(k*2)] 
            i = i + (k * 2) 
        return res
