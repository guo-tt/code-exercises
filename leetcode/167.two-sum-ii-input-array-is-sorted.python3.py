#
# Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find
# two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
# 
# The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they
# add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may
# not use the same element twice.
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output: [1,2]
# Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
#
