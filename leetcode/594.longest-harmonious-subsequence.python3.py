#
# We define a harmonious array is an array where the difference between its
# maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.
# 
# Now, given an integer array, you need to find the length of its longest
# harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# The length of the input array will not exceed 20,000.
