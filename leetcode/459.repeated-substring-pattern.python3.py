# Testcase Example:  '"abab"'
#
# Given a non-empty string check if it can be constructed by taking a substring
# of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. You may assume
# the given string consists of lowercase English letters only and its length
# will not exceed 10000.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: "abab"
# Output: True
# Explanation: It's the substring "ab" twice.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: "aba"
# Output: False
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: "abcabcabcabc"
# Output: True
# Explanation: It's the substring "abc" four times. (And the substring "abcabc"
# twice.)
